# Fake_News_Detection_system
Built a Fake News Detection system using NLP and a Decision Tree classifier, trained on a labeled Twitter dataset. Developed a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit where users can input news and get real-time predictions as Reliable or Unreliable. This project showcases my skills in machine learning and NLP.
